# Monorepo Strategies: Selective Builds for Changed Applications

Monorepo is the practice of storing all your code in a single repository, which
can be beneficial for code sharing, dependency management, and version control.

However, there is no free lunch! As your codebase grows, managing builds become
unavoidably complex and time-consuming. This time is billed on your
organization and it can get quite costly.

In this blog post, we'll explore the challenges of building only changed
applications in a monorepo and discuss strategies to optimize your workflow
with selective builds.

If this gets you excited, let's dive in!
