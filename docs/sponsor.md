# Sponsorship

I gotta be straight with you.

I write because I enjoy doing so. It's a pure labor of love.

In simple terms, it makes me happy. :innocent:

In addition, it thrills me to see people reading and commenting on various
covered topics, whether on the site, or when promoting it on social media
platforms, e.g. Reddit, Hackernews, Mastodon, Bluesky, etc.

Regardless, if you are interested in providing financial support, or just a
donation out of love :hugging:, here are various ways you can do so:

- GitHub Sponsorship: <https://github.com/sponsors/meysam81>
- Bitcoin Address: `bc1qfn42dnpdderesp5a5fwjx9y70dut4m0p9emx27`
- Paypal: <https://paypal.me/meysamazad>
- Buy me a coffee: <https://buymeacoffee.com/meysam>
- Proton Mail Referral (a free month of Mail Plus): <https://pr.tn/ref/NS19KFG8SQBG>
- Hetzner Referral (get â‚¬20 credit): <https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=ai5E5vaX1J71>
