# Sponsorship

I gotta be straight with you.

I write because I enjoy doing so. It's a pure labor of love.

In simple terms, it makes me happy. :innocent:

In addition, it thrills me to see people reading and commenting on various
covered topics, whether on the site, or when promoting it on social media
platforms, e.g. Reddit, Hackernews, Mastodon, Bluesky, etc.

Furthermore, I learn by doing, and even more so by reading comments from people
sharing how they have approached the same problem from a different angle!
:handshake:

donation out of love :hugging:, here are various ways you can do so:
